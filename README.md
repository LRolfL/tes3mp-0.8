# tes3mp-rolf
Repository with my own scripts for TES3MP 0.8.0 and 0.8.1.

Hi, if there are any mistakes you can advise me or modify it yourself.
Do whatever you want with my scripts as long as you mention that the original work is mine.

-- finallyVampireWerewolf: Makes possible for everyone to become vampire or werewolf without console commands.

-- levelsControl: Provides the capacity to adjust (limit or allow) attributes, skills, level and more to a given number.

-- cellTracker: An easy way to know in which cell and region you are moving through the message box.

Not working for the latest version:

-- magickaRegen: Adds magicka regeneration to players. Adjusts the amount of regeneration and its timing.
