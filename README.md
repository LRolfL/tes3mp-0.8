# tes3mp-rolf
A repository with my scripts made to TES3MP 8.0 and 8.1.

Welcome, i am new at scripting, so try not to be too hard on me. If there is any error or problem you can suggest it or modify my own script, there is no problem,
do whatever you want as long as you mention that the original work is mine.

-- charactersControl: To provide the capacity to adjust (cap or allow) attributes, skills and level to a certain number...

-- FinallyVampireWerewolf: To make everyone can become a vampire or werewolf without commands console...
