# tes3mp-rolf
Repository with my own scripts for TES3MP 0.8.0 and 0.8.1.

Welcome, I am new at scripting, so if there are any mistakes you can suggest them or modify it yourself, there is no problem,
do whatever you want as long as you mention the original work is mine.

-- charactersControl: Provides the capacity to adjust (limit or allow) attributes, skills, and level to a given number.

-- finallyVampireWerewolf: Makes everyone able to become a vampire or werewolf without console commands.

-- simplyRegenMagicka: Simpler way to add players magicka regeneration and adjust the amount of regeneration and its timing.
