# tes3mp-rolf
Repository with my own scripts for TES3MP 0.8.0 and 0.8.1.

Hi, I am new, so if there are any mistakes you can advise me or modify it yourself.
Do whatever you want with my scripts as long as you mention that the original work is mine.

-- charactersControl: Provides the capacity to adjust (limit or allow) attributes, skills, and level to a given number.

-- finallyVampireWerewolf: Makes everyone able to become a vampire or werewolf without console commands.


Not working for the latest version:

-- simplyRegenMagicka: Simple way to add players magicka regeneration and adjust the amount of regeneration and its timing.
