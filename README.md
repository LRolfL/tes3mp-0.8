# tes3mp-rolf
A repository with my own scripts made to TES3MP 0.8.0 and 0.8.1.

Welcome, I am new at scripting, so try not to be too hard on me. If there are any errors you can suggest them or modify my own script, there is no problem,
do whatever you want as long as you mention that the original work is mine.

-- charactersControl: To provide the capacity to adjust (limit or allow) attributes, skills, and level to a given number.

-- finallyVampireWerewolf: To make everyone can become a vampire or a werewolf without console commands.

-- simplyRegenMagicka: A simpler way to add players magicka regeneration and adjust the amount of regeneration and its timing.
